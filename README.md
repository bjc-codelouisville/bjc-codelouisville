- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bjc-codelouisville
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in networking, virtualization, cooking, database management...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning App Dev with C# through Code:Louisville (https://code-you.org) and plan to continue on to learn Web Dev with JavaScript
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm not a developer, yet... Any repositories here are related to Code:Louisville
